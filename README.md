# Mac
i dont have a signature, so your mac computer will try to block it, since it doesnt trust the app.
to fix this, you can:
1. Start the app
2. Wait for your computer "verify" it
3. Go into settings > Privacy & Security
4. Scroll all the way down
5. Allow the app to open
You will only have to do this once every time you download it
